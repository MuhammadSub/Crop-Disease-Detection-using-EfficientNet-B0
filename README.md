# Crop-Disease-Detection-using-EfficientNet-B0

#Objective:
This project aims to detect and classify crop diseases using a machine learning model based on the EfficientNet B0 architecture. The model is trained on a dataset containing 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into 38 different classes. The training process involves 10 epochs, and the model's performance is evaluated on a separate test set.
